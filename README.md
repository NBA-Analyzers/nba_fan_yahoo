### Example Conversations
```
You: "How is my team performing this week?"
AI: "Your team is projected to win 7 out of 9 categories this week. 
     Your strongest categories are points and assists, but you're 
     weak in rebounds. Consider streaming a big man for tomorrow's games."

You: "Who should I pick up from the waiver wire?"
AI: "Based on your team's needs and upcoming schedules, I recommend 
     picking up [Player Name]. He has 4 games this week and fills 
     your biggest gap in three-point shooting."

You: "Should I accept this trade offer?"
AI: "That trade would improve your rebounds and blocks but hurt your 
     assists. Given your current league standing and team composition, 
     I'd suggest countering with [specific recommendation]."
